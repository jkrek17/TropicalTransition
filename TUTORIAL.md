# Tropical Cyclone and Ship Track Visualization Project: Full Tutorial

> **Note**: If you're new to this project, please begin with `STUDENT_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for installation instructions.

## 1. Project Overview

This project visualizes tropical cyclone (storm) tracks and ship movements on both interactive web maps and static presentation maps. It uses real-world data from NOAA (for storms) and AIS/SeaVision (for ships). The project is modular, configurable, and demonstrates best practices in Python data science and mapping.

**Advanced Feature**: The project includes sophisticated handling of **dateline crossing** - one of the most challenging problems in weather data mapping.

---

## 2. Critical Challenge: Dateline Crossing

### The Problem

When tropical cyclones or ship tracks cross the International Date Line (180Â° longitude), traditional mapping approaches fail because:

- **Track Discontinuity**: Lines appear to "jump" from one side of the map to the other
- **Global Wrapping**: Maps show the entire globe instead of focusing on the data
- **Coordinate Confusion**: Longitudes switch from negative to positive values
- **Incorrect Distances**: Great-circle paths are not rendered correctly

### Our Solution

The project automatically detects and handles dateline crossing:

```python
# Automatic detection of dateline crossing
dateline_crossing = (lon_min < 0 and lon_max > 0) or (lon_min < 180 and lon_max > 180)

if dateline_crossing:
    # Use 0-360 longitude system with central_longitude=180
    projection = ccrs.PlateCarree(central_longitude=180)
    # Transform coordinates to 0-360 for plotting
    lons = [lon + 360 if lon < 0 else lon for lon in lons]
    # Set focused extent (120-240Â°) to avoid global wrapping
    extent = (120, 240, lat_min, lat_max)
else:
    # Standard -180 to 180 system for normal data
    projection = ccrs.PlateCarree()
    # Use original coordinates
    extent = (lon_min, lon_max, lat_min, lat_max)
```

### Real-World Applications

This solution is essential for:
- **Pacific Typhoons**: Many cross the dateline during their lifecycle
- **Global Shipping**: Trans-Pacific voyages often cross 180Â° longitude
- **Climate Research**: Long-term storm tracking across ocean basins
- **Maritime Safety**: Accurate visualization of vessel movements

## 4. Key Technologies

- **Python**: Data processing, mapping, and automation
- **Pandas/GeoPandas**: Data wrangling and geospatial operations
- **Folium**: Interactive web maps (uses Leaflet.js)
- **Matplotlib/Cartopy**: High-quality static maps for presentations
- **NOAA HURDAT2**: Real storm data
- **AIS/SeaVision CSV**: Real ship track data
- **Advanced Cartopy**: Dateline crossing handling with coordinate system selection

---

## 5. How the Project Works

### a. Data Processing

- **Ship Data**: Reads either a sample or real ship track CSV, parses timestamps, coordinates, speed, and heading, and creates a GeoDataFrame.
- **Storm Data**: Uses either sample data or real NOAA HURDAT2 data (downloaded and parsed) for storm tracks.

### b. Dateline Detection and Handling

- **Automatic Detection**: Analyzes coordinate bounds to detect dateline crossing
- **Coordinate System Selection**: Chooses appropriate projection (-180/180 or 0/360)
- **Dynamic Extent Calculation**: Creates focused map bounds that avoid global wrapping
- **Coordinate Transformation**: Transforms coordinates only when needed for dateline crossing

### c. GeoJSON Creation

- Both ship and storm data are converted to GeoJSON format for easy mapping and sharing.

### d. Mapping

- **Interactive Map**: Uses Folium to create a web map with layers for ship tracks and storm tracks, custom icons, popups, and measurement tools.
- **Static Map**: Uses Matplotlib and Cartopy to create a high-resolution PNG map for offline use and presentations, with advanced dateline handling.
- **Data Table**: Generates a PNG image of a table summarizing the ship and storm data.

### e. Configuration

- All map appearance, data paths, and output settings are controlled in `config.py` for easy customization.

## 6. How to Run the Project

> **Note**: If you haven't set up Python and VS Code yet, please refer to `STUDENT_SETUP_GUIDE.md` first.

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Add your data**:
   - Place real ship track CSVs in `data/`
   - Place HURDAT2 storm data in `data/` (or let the downloader fetch it)

3. **Run the main script**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **View results**:
   - Open `output/tropical_cyclone_map.html` in your browser for the interactive map
   - Use `output/tropical_cyclone_map_static.png` for presentations
   - Check `output/data_table.png` for a summary table

**Note**: The system will automatically detect if your data crosses the dateline and handle it appropriately.

## 9. How to Extend the Project

- Add more ship tracks or storms by placing new CSVs in the `data/` folder.
- Change map appearance or output settings in `config.py`.
- Add new map layers (e.g., ports, weather) by extending the mapping modules.
- Use the data table output for further analysis or reporting.
- Test with data that crosses the dateline to see the advanced handling in action.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

- If you see errors about missing data, check that your CSV files are in the correct folder and formatted properly.
- If the map doesn't show expected data, check the GeoJSON files in `output/` for issues.
- For any Python errors, check the traceback for which module or data file is causing the problem.
- If tracks appear discontinuous, check if your data crosses the dateline - the system should handle this automatically.
