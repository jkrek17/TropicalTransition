## 3. Setting Up the Project

### Step 1: Download the Project
1. Download the project files (from your course materials or GitHub)
2. Extract the files to a folder on your computer
3. Open VS Code

### Step 2: Open the Project in VS Code
1. In VS Code, go to `File` â†’ `Open Folder`
2. Navigate to the project folder you extracted
3. Click "Select Folder"
4. You should see the project files in the left sidebar

### Step 3: Set Up Virtual Environment (Recommended)
A virtual environment helps isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts:

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - **Windows (Command Prompt)**:
   ```bash
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   - **Windows (PowerShell)**:
   ```bash
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
   - **macOS/Linux**:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Verify activation** (you should see `(.venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt):
```bash
which python  # macOS/Linux
where python   # Windows
```

### Step 4: Install Project Dependencies
1. Open a terminal in VS Code: `Terminal` â†’ `New Terminal`
2. Make sure you're in the project folder and your virtual environment is activated
3. Run this command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note**: If you encounter permission errors, you may need to upgrade pip first:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

## 4. Running the Project

### Step 1: Verify Your Setup
1. In the VS Code terminal, run:
```bash
python --version
pip list
```
2. You should see Python installed and several packages listed

### Step 2: Execute the Project
1. In the VS Code terminal, run:
```bash
python main.py
```
2. You should see output similar to:
```
ðŸŒŠ Tropical Cyclone and Ship Track Visualization Project
============================================================
Creating both interactive and static maps...
ðŸ“Š Processing ship track data...
ðŸš¢ Using real ship track data...
```

### Step 3: Examine the Results
1. Navigate to the `output` folder in VS Code
2. You should see the following generated files:
   - `tropical_cyclone_map.html` (interactive map)
   - `tropical_cyclone_map_static.png` (static map)
   - `data_table.png` (data summary)

---

## 5. Examining the Results

### Interactive Map
1. Right-click on `tropical_cyclone_map.html` in VS Code
2. Select "Reveal in File Explorer" (Windows) or "Reveal in Finder" (macOS)
3. Double-click the file to open it in your web browser
4. Explore the interactive features:
   - Click on ship markers for detailed information
   - Use the layer controls to show/hide data layers
   - Experiment with different map background styles

### Static Map
1. Open `tropical_cyclone_map_static.png` in any image viewer
2. This high-quality map is suitable for presentations and reports

### Data Table
1. Open `data_table.png` to view a comprehensive summary of the ship and storm data

### Interactive Jupyter Notebook
The project includes an interactive Jupyter notebook for learning about dateline crossing:
- **File**: `dateline_demo.ipynb`
- **Purpose**: Demonstrates dateline crossing challenges and solutions
- **Usage**: See [JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_GUIDE.md](JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Python is not recognized"
- **Solution**: Reinstall Python and ensure "Add to PATH" is selected during installation
- **Alternative**: Use `python3` instead of `python` in commands

### "pip is not recognized"
- **Solution**: Install pip separately or use `python -m pip` instead

### "Module not found" errors
- **Solution**: Ensure you have executed `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Alternative**: Install missing packages individually:
```bash
pip install pandas geopandas folium matplotlib cartopy
```

### VS Code doesn't show Python
- **Solution**: Install the Python extension and restart VS Code
- **Alternative**: Select Python interpreter manually: `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ "Python: Select Interpreter"

### Map files don't appear
- **Solution**: Verify that the script executed without errors
- **Alternative**: Check the `output` folder for any error messages



### Virtual environment issues
- **Solution**: Make sure you've activated your virtual environment before installing packages
- **Check**: Look for `(.venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt
- **Deactivate**: Type `deactivate` to exit the virtual environment

### Permission errors when installing packages
- **Solution**: Use `python -m pip install --upgrade pip` to upgrade pip first
- **Alternative**: Use `pip install --user` to install packages for your user only
- **Note**: On some systems, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python`

### Import errors or module not found
- **Solution**: Ensure you're in the correct directory and virtual environment is activated
- **Check**: Verify all files are in the correct folders as shown in the project structure
- **Alternative**: Try running `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` instead

### Cartopy installation issues
- **Solution**: Cartopy can be tricky to install. Try: `conda install -c conda-forge cartopy` if you have conda
- **Alternative**: Install dependencies first: `pip install numpy matplotlib shapely`
- **Note**: Some systems may require additional system-level dependencies

### Memory or performance issues
- **Solution**: Close other applications while running the visualization
- **Alternative**: Try reducing the data size or map resolution in `config.py`
- **Note**: Large datasets may require more RAM

## 7. Next Steps

### Explore the Code
1. Open `main.py` in VS Code
2. Review the code to understand the functionality of each component
3. Experiment with modifying settings in `config.py` to observe their effects on the maps

### Experiment with Your Own Data
1. Add your own ship track CSV files to the `data` folder
2. Execute the project again to visualize your data on the maps
3. Test different map configuration settings
